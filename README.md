## Acknowledgement

I took inspiration from Astra, Kadence, Blocksy and GeneratePress themes etc. GeneratePress theme's performance optimization technique helped me to further improve Roach Theme speed.

All these themes are under [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/) which provides anybody the rights and freedom to study how they work and modify them.

I'm grateful to these themes for inspiration and we hope someday Rishi Theme will inspire other theme developers too.

I also want to thank various websites and blogs for providing photos and tutorials which I used in Roach Theme.
