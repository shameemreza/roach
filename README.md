## Acknowledgement

This theme has been developed for the sole learning purpose. I have copied techniques from many themes and tutorials available online. I also took inspiration from Astra, Kadence, Blocksy, GeneratePress themes, etc. GeneratePress theme's performance optimization technique helped me a lot to further improve its loading speed.

All these themes are under [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/) which provides anybody the rights and freedom to study how they work and modify them.

I'm grateful to these themes and tutorials for inspiration, and I hope someday Roach Theme will inspire other theme developers too.

I also want to thank various websites for providing photos I used in Roach Theme.
